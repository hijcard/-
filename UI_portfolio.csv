Metaverse,Watch,Interaction,M,dark,"<p>We keep getting good feedback from teams <strong>applying product management to internal platforms</strong>. One key feature to remember, though: It's not just about team structure or renaming existing platform teams; it’s also about applying product-centric working practices within the team. Specifically, we've received feedback that teams face challenges with this technique unless they have a product-centric mindset. This likely means additional roles, such as a product manager, alongside changes to other areas, such as requirements gathering and the measurement of success. Working this way means establishing empathy with internal consumers (the development teams) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers create roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. We continue to see this technique as key to building internal platforms to roll out new digital solutions quickly and efficiently.</p>"
